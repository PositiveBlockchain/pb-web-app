The technology uses a phone number-based identity system with address-based encryption and eigentrust-based reputation. Celo&#x2019;s stablecoins are stable value currencies, implemented by an algorithmic reserve-backed stabilization mechanism. The first stablecoin, cUSD, is pegged to the US Dollar.&#xD;
&#xD;
Build on Celo&#xD;
Celo is a platform that is open and open-source, allowing for an ecosystem of powerful applications built on top, including easier cash transfer programs, peer-to-peer lending, collaborative small-scale insurance, and other digital assets and wallets.&#xD;
&#xD;
Earn with Celo&#xD;
Celo increases access by enabling anyone with even a simple Android smartphone to participate and earn Celo for decentralized verifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mobile-First Platform&#xD;
To create a truly inclusive financial system, we started by building an infrastructure to serve those excluded from the current system. Celo&#x2019;s protocol includes unique features that create a seamless user experience on mobile phones.&#xD;
